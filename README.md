Introduction:
Here we are going to describe about the prescription System with firebird 5. Robots are virtual or mechanical objects that are used in facilitating the occurrence of multiple everyday activities. The virtual and mechanical robots have assisted people in a variety of tasks within and outside the laboratory and operating rooms. Some examples of robot intervention include medication administration, assisting children with autism, telemedicine, and transferring / lifting patients. Although robots have made many activities easier to handle, there have been various  consequences associated with utilizing such technology which has impacted ethical policy and pharmacist staffing.

Introduction to android blue tooth controller:
These APIs let applications wirelessly connect to other Bluetooth devices, enabling point-to-point and multipoint wireless features. Using the Bluetooth controller, an Android application can perform the following: 
•	Scan for other Bluetooth devices. 
•	Query the local Bluetooth adapter for paired Bluetooth devices.
•	Establish RFCOMM channels.
•	Connect to other devices through service discovery. 
•	Transfer data to and from other devices.
•	Manage multiple connections.



Configuration of blue tooth via XBEE:
Configuration of Bluetooth is performed by XBEE. Here by we are using X-CTU application for configuring the Bluetooth. XBEE are hugely popular wireless transceivers for a number of reasons. They’re flexible – they send and receive data over a serial port, which means they’re compatible with both computers and microcontrollers (like Arduino). 

And they’re highly configurable – you can have meshed networks with dozens of XBEE, or just a pair swapping data. You can use them to remotely control your robot, or arrange them all over your house to monitor temperatures or lighting conditions in every room. With an XBEE Explorer connected between your computer and your XBEE, and with the help of the X-CTU software, you can easily configure XBEE, test connections, and pass data between your computer, mobile and remote XBEE. 

Keywords - serial port, X-CTU, XBEE.


Connecting with firebird 5:
We assume that you are able to setup a Firebird V bot. You need to attach a Bluetooth Communication module to the bot. Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a set of interface specifications for high speed wired communication between electronics systems peripherals and devices with or without PC/computer. 

The goal of this project is to serve as a prototype for such venture having set the paths to a wide range of new opportunities in the field of remote controlled robots interaction. The proposed work designed to develop a robotic vehicle that is controlled by a Bluetooth device. 

Bluetooth operation is achieved by any smart-phone/Tablet etc., with Android OS, upon a GUI (Graphical User Interface) based touch screen operation. It consists of a HC-06 Bluetooth module circuit and ATMEGA2560 microcontroller is used for the desired operation. At the transmitting end user send the command using android application, commands are sent to the receiver to control the movement of the robot either to move forward, backward and left or right etc. 

At the receiving end two motors are interfaced to the microcontroller where they are used for the movement of the vehicle. The android application device transmitter acts as a remote control. While the receiver end Bluetooth device is fed to the microcontroller to drive servo motors via motor driver IC for necessary work. 

Keywords - ATmega2560, Android OS, Bluetooth interface, Fire Bird V robot


Role of AI in this project:
According to this project, AI performs the role where it gets the permission or input from the user. For example, if you are going to schedule your medical prescriptions in your android mobile application, and configured that input to the firebird 5 via Bluetooth.

 If you forget to take the medicine at particular time means, the firebird 5 remembers you by asking you that it could bring you a medicine, if you said yes, it automatically brings you the particular medicine.

 The Artificial Intelligence and Robotics although addressing in similar problems. The two fields interact profitably in the area of building intelligent agents; this inter action has resulted in important developments in the area of vision and phased action. 

Recent advancements of technologies, including computation, robotics, machine learning communication, and miniaturization technologies, brings us closer to futuristic visions of compassionate intelligent devices. The missing element is a basic understanding of how to relate human functions (physiological, physical, and cognitive) to the design of intelligent devices and systems that aid and interact with people. 

Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation and application of robots and computer systems for their control sensory feedback, and information processing. 

Keywords: Intelligent Agent, Manipulators, Robotics, Effector.


Use of automatic arm:
This Simple mechatronic project consists of a robot an arm or mechanism the pick-up objects from one place and put them in a basket or another location suggested by figure.
•	Control: Obtaining information from a keypad or a joysticks.
•	Actuator: Moving the arm and the gripper. An alternative for the gripper in a simplified project is use of an electromagnet, if the objects to be moved can be attracted by it. 
•	 Sensor: Optionally, we can send information to the operator such as whether the basket is empty or full, whether there are obstacles, and if the object falls before it is placed in the basket
•	 Effects: Light or sound effects can be added; a light can flush or a counter can be ratcheted up the object falls into the Basket.
With the help of this automatic arm the firebird 5 kit or the robot is going to pick the medicines in this project.
